Arrays:

Syantax: 

Eg: int []arr = new int[size];
Eg: float []arr = new float[size];
Eg: Student []sarr = new Student[size];

int []arr = {1,2,3,4,5};


Types of Arrays:

1) 1D Arrays
2) 2D Arrays -> int [][] mat = new int[row][col];
3) Multi Dimension Arrays 
Eg: 3D Arrays -> int [][][] mat = new int[no of 2D][rows][cols];
4) Jagged Arrays
Eg: int [][] mat = new int[4][];
    mat[0] = new int[5];
    mat[1] = new int[7];
    mat[2] = new int[8];
